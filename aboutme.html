      <h2>Past</h2>
      <h3> <!-- Problem Solving 2. I forgot to put <h> tags around <p> tags and text was not loading. -->
        <p>During my highschool days, I was dead set on becoming a general manager of a hotel. My passion was for hospitality and hotels because I loved traveling. I started my hotel career in 2018 and after 5 years I've found out that it is not what I am interested in. Growing up before highschool, I loved video games. My first gaming system was a GameBoy and grew into owning an Alienware Aurora R6 today. I always had a curiosity of how things work and I didn't know until now that engineering was a specialty where I can figure out how things work.</p>

      <h2>Present</h2>
      <h3>
        <p>At 24 years old, I am making a career change from Hospitality of Computer Science. I am currently a Catering Sales Manager but am working on side projects to build my portfolio in software engineering. This website is one of my first projects!</p>
      </h3>

      <h2>Future</h2>
      <h3>
      <p>I have enrolled at an accredited university to receive a Master's in Computer Science. I plan to continue working on personal side projects to stack up my portfolio. My dream is to become a software engineer for a big game studio and would like to dable in gaming development.</p>
